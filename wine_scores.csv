2001,Saint-Émilion,Red,Mature,Table,Proprietary Blend,"Robert M. Parker, Jr.",97,2015,2030,27/08/2015,"A real sleeper of the vintage, and somewhat underrated and under the radar after the greatness of 2000, the 2001 Angelus is on a faster evolutionary track than the 2000, but it is a plush, sexy, succulent style of Angelus with a dense plum/purple color, loads of chocolate, blueberry and blackberry fruit, telltale floral scents in the intense fragrance, and a lush, voluptuously textured and opulent mouthfeel. This wine seems to have entered its plateau of maturity, where it should stay for at least another 10-15 years. It is a major sleeper of the vintage.",1006045,10060452001
2002,Saint-Émilion,Red,Old,Table,Proprietary Blend,"Robert M. Parker, Jr.",91,2005,2020,28/04/2005,"A successful offering for the vintage, the 2002 exhibits a deep ruby/purple/plum color as well as a sweet, forward style with black fruits intermixed with espresso roast, lavender, and Provencal herbs. Medium to full-bodied, lush, and round, with fine purity, ripeness, and surprising body and sweetness for a right bank 2002, it can be drunk now or cellared for 12-15 years.",1006045,10060452002
2003,Saint-Émilion,Red,Mature,Table,Proprietary Blend,"Robert M. Parker, Jr.",98,2015,2025,27/08/2015,"I had this wine from my cellar, as well as at a tasting in Zurich in February of 2015. It is one of the handful of 2003s I bought from the Right Bank of Bordeaux in this vintage. Angelus really nailed the vintage, and has produced a fully mature wine that’s truly strutting its stuff. Dense, bluish/purple, it offers gorgeous notes of espresso roast, blackberry and blueberry liqueur, acacia flowers and a touch of chocolate. It is full-bodied, opulent and seems close to full maturity, as it is evolving quickly. The wine is full-bodied, rich and should be drunk over the next decade.",1006045,10060452003

Parker, Jr.",95,2009,2022,28/06/2007,"This 7,500-case blend of 62% Merlot and 38% Cabernet Franc is one of the strongest wines of the vintage. A deep blue/purple hue is accompanied by classic aromas of smoky blueberries and blackberries as well as incense and floral notes in the background. A beautiful texture, opulence, flamboyance, and purity characterize this stunningly deep, full-bodied effort, another great success from proprietor Hubert de Bouard.

This sensational, opaque, bluish/purple wine offers up notes of vanillin, spring flowers, blueberry and blackberry liqueur, plus a touch of licorice. The wine hits the palate with a thunderous cascade of ripe, rich, concentrated fruit. It is full-bodied, multidimensional and layered. The tannins are beautifully integrated but still present, and the wood, acidity, alcohol, etc., are all beautifully assimilated in this magnificent, majestic vintage of Angelus. It can be drunk now, but it is still an adolescent and that suggests it has at least another 25-35 years of longevity.",1006045,10060452005

The 2006 Château Angelus, a blend of 47% Cabernet Franc, 50% Merlot and 3% Cabernet Sauvignon, has a very perfumed bouquet with scents of blueberry, cassis, crushed violets and just a touch of mushroom. This is very generous. The palate is medium-bodied with a smooth, slightly toasty entry. The acidity is quite low compared to other 2006 Saint Emilions, but there is harmony here and the tannins seem very fine. There is real density on the finish, although I was just seeking a little more delineation to come through. Give this another two or three years in bottle. Tasted January 2016.",1006045,10060452006

The palate is very crisp and nicely structured on the entry. The acidity is very well judged, and there is a sense of effortless charm in the silky smooth, lightly spiced finish.

There are some floral notes, as well as forest floor and lead pencil nuances.

Boysenberries, stewed plums, blackcurrant cordial and black raspberries all burst from the glass, followed up by nuances of tar, star anise, mocha and unsmoked cigars plus a waft of camphor. The big, rich, full-bodied palate is built like a brick house, featuring super firm, ripe, grainy tannins and tons of freshness to support the taut, muscular black fruits, finishing very long and savory. It's starting to enter its drinking window, but based on this tasting, I would recommend waiting another 3-5 years before broaching and then drinking it over the next 40+ years.",1006045,10060452010

Supple and sexy with lots of blueberry and black raspberry fruit intermixed with licorice, barbecue smoke and camphor, this medium to full-bodied, supple-textured, sexy effort offers delicious drinking now, and promises to become even better over the next decade.

It is undoubtedly detailed and energetic, a subtle marine scent surfacing with continued aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with rounded and supple tannin, slightly honeyed in texture yet with a keen line of acidity running through it. Impressive body and mass, yet primal, surly and broody. Perhaps only now is it starting to flex its muscles. This is a well crafted and opulent Saint Emilion with a long future ahead and it may warrant a higher score in the future. Those who cellar this for over a decade will see this in full flight. Tasted December 2016.",1006045,10060452012

With medium body and more texture than is found in most 2013s, it should drink well for 8-10 years. This vineyard is meticulously manicured and the wine is brilliantly made by Hubert de Bouard.",1006045,10060452013

The palate is delicately intense with soft spoken floral and earth notes complimenting the black fruits, supported by ripe, rounded tannins and oodles of freshness, finishing long with compelling restraint. Sporting a good amount of tertiary nuances, it can be enjoyed right now, but make sure to decant it a good 1.5 to two hours prior to drinking.",1006045,10060452014

Full-bodied, the palate is fabulously opulent, delivering mouth-coating black and red fruit layers with loads of floral sparkles and a seductively velvety texture, finishing with great length and tension.",1006045,10060452015

The palate is pure decadence. Medium to full-bodied, rich and generously fruited, this wine is by no means heavy—it positively glimmers with freshness and vivacity, lending an ethereal nature to all that richness and power, beautifully framed by velvety tannins and finishing with epic length. The generosity, layers and plushness make for an absolutely DELICIOUS drink right now, but I'd suggest waiting 3-5 more years for the fireworks to really begin.",1006045,10060452016

The medium to full-bodied palate is carrying a little new oak at this youthful stage, framing the generous red and black fruits along with ripe, plush grape-skin tannins and seamless freshness, finishing long and spicy.

Its amazingly plush, silken texture carries all these shimmering flavors to a very long and fragrant finish. This jaw-dropping expression of 2020 is simply stunning. The blend this year is 40% Cabernet Franc and 60% Merlot, due to be aged 18-22 months in French oak barriques, 100% new, and two new foudres.

2001,Barbaresco,Red,Late,Table,Nebbiolo,Antonio Galloni,93,2012,2021,25/04/2012,"The 2001 Barbaresco is gorgeous. Sweet balsamic notes open on the bouquet, followed intense, silky layers of fruit. The 2001 is subtle, classy and elegant from start to finish. Hints of early maturity appear in the aromatics, but the wine has more than enough fruit to support at least another decade of fine drinking. Tobacco, sweet herbs and licorice add the final notes of complexity. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2021. Angelo Gaja isn’t the talkative type too often these days. Most of the time I am greeted, left alone in a room to taste, and then greeted again before I leave. On this day, though, Gaja started talking about vintages, and in particular the misconception that wines from hot years don’t age. Gaja cited 1961, a warm year in Piedmont, and one of the most legendary at the time. The wines aged just fine, added Gaja. What struck me most, though, was how clear Gaja’s recollection was of events that transpired fifty years ago. I know only one other person in Piedmont who has a similarly sharp memory that goes that far back. What does that have to do with these 2001s? Not much, except that it seemed like an interesting anecdote to share. Importer: Terlato Wines International, Lake Bluff, IL; tel. (847) 604 8900",1099605,10996052001
2003,Barbaresco,Red,Late,Table,Nebbiolo,Antonio Galloni,93,2009,2021,30/10/2006,"Gaja’s 2003 Barbaresco may well challenge its bigger siblings as the most successful of these new releases. Made in a style that combines expressive aromatics, the ripeness of the vintage and classic structure, it is an awesome effort. Though it offers plenty of super-ripe fruit and notable concentration, it never comes across as being heavy and displays exceptional overall balance. Gaja’s Barbaresco rarely shows this well so early in the game and my guess is that my score may end up being conservative. “Oddly enough it was our worst-exposed parcels that performed best in 2003, although I suppose that makes sense given that these plots were more protected from the sun. We did a very severe selection in the cellar and in 2003 we bottled a small amount of Barbaresco, roughly 30,000 bottles as compared to our normal amount of 70,000 bottles. We did a similarly stringent selection with our single-vineyard wines,” adds Gaja. Anticipated maturity: 2009-2021. Importer: Paterno Imports, Lake Bluff, IL; tel.

This is a wine of rare class, elegance and pure breed. It offers outstanding length and silky, elegant tannins to round out the inviting finish. Anticipated maturity: 2009-2024. Angelo Gaja and long-time oenologist Guido Rivella produced some of the most monumental wines of their long, storied partnership in 2004. Although I admire Gaja’s wines, especially for their consistency, I rarely find them this emotionally moving and utterly profound. The stable weather and cool, tempering evenings towards the end of the growing season allowed Gaja and Rivella to harvest fairly late in 2004. I remember passing by Gaja’s Barbaresco vineyards in October of that year and seeing fruit still waiting to be picked long after most producers had already brought the fruit in. Gaja’s 2004s from Barbaresco are especially breathtaking for their clarity and precision. The wines also seem less internationally-styled than in the past. Readers fortunate enough to possess the means to acquire these wines won’t want to miss them! The 2003s from the Barolo zones of La Morra and Serralunga are also strong efforts considering the vintage. “Historically in Piedmont there has been an inverse relationship between quality and quantity. Great vintages like 1961 and 1989 were characterized by low yields,” says Gaja. “2004 is one of those rare vintages like 1964 and 1990 where quality is high even though yields were generous as well. I think 2004 is a very elegant vintage. It is much easier to achieve opulence in the wines, but finesse is always much more elusive.” Importer: Terlato Wines International, Lake Bluff, IL; tel.

This is a firm, classically built wine of notable elegance. The tannins are substantial yet beautifully woven into the wine’s mid-weight frame. This is another beautiful Barbaresco from Angelo Gaja, but it will require patience as it is tightly wound today. Anticipated maturity: 2015-2030. I was blown away by Angelo Gaja’s 2005 wines from Barbaresco. When all is said and done, Gaja may have well produced not the wine, but rather the wines of the vintage in a year that was excellent but not profound. While Gaja’s 2005 don’t have the explosive, multi-dimensional personalities of his 2004s, they are vibrant offerings that will thrill readers who love Piedmont wines. As always, Gaja blends in a small percentage of Barbera in his single-vineyard wines, but that is hardly noticeable in this vintage. I also noted less new oak than has generally been the case in the recent past. The wines showcase very pure expressions of Nebbiolo and are made in a style that appears to make fewer concessions to the decidedly international approach of previous vintages. In short, these are the most Piedmontese wines I have tasted from Angelo Gaja in a long time. Could it be that the greatest innovator in Piedmont over the last thirty five-plus years has taken a small step towards a more classic style?

This is a remarkably soft, harmonious Barbaresco from Angelo Gaja with pretty notes of raspberries, crushed flowers and spices. The wine turns more powerful in the glass, as it gains additional richness, volume and depth, all of which carry through to the polished finish. The wine’s balance is impeccable, and this is easily is one the more harmonious, complete wines of the vintage. Anticipated maturity: 2016-2026. Angelo Gaja's 2006s from Barbaresco are lovely, although they require a bit of aeration to find their focus. Tthe 2006 Barbaresco in particular is quite an achievement in this challenging vintage.

2007,Barbaresco,Red,Early,Table,Nebbiolo,Antonio Galloni,94,2017,2032,26/02/2010,"All readers need to do is taste the 2007 Barbaresco to get a sense of the promise the vintage holds at Gaja. Soft and seamless on the palate, the Barbaresco shows wonderful integrity in its fruit in an opulent, yet mid-weight style. Fragrant, perfumed aromatics are woven throughout, while an attractive spiciness develops in the glass. There is incredible depth to the fruit and simply phenomenal overall balance. Readers will not want to miss this Barbaresco; arguably Gaja’s finest since 1997. Anticipated maturity: 2017-2032. My most recent visit to Gaja was quite an experience, as I tasted all of the estate’s 1989s, 1990s and 2007s. The 1989s and 1990s are reviewed in this issue’s What About Now feature. Angelo Gaja, always loquacious on a wide range of subjects, says virtually nothing about his wines, an approach I have increasingly come to appreciate in an era where so many producers are constantly in pitch mode. Then again, Gaja doesn’t really need to say anything, the wines speak for themselves. I tasted the 2007s at the winery in November 2009 and then again in New York in January 2010. Both times they were spectacular. Stylistically the 2007s remind me of the 1997s in terms of their opulence. Gaja’s wines are often immensely appealing when young – which is certainly the case with the 2007s – but then close down in bottle for a number of years, sometimes many years. My impression is that the Costa Russi and Conteisa are the most likely of these 2007s to offer the widest drinking windows throughout their lives with a minimum of cellaring. Fermentation and malolactic fermentation take place in steel. The wines then spend approximately one year in French oak and a second year in cask prior to being bottled. As has been the case for a number of years now, Gaja’s Langhe wines incorporate a small percentage of Barbera. On a final note, it’s great to see Gaja’s daughters Gaia and Rossana increasingly involved in the winery. They, and their younger brother Giovanni, have big shoes to fill, but couldn’t have asked for better teachers than Angelo and Lucia Gaja. Importer: Terlato Wines International, Lake Bluff, IL; tel.

This is an attractive Barbaresco with excellent depth and a firm, tannic spine that is very nicely integrated with the fruit. The 2008 isn’t a blockbuster, but it should drink well with minimum cellaring. This is a classic, linear Barbaresco endowed with terrific energy and focus. Right now the 2008 seems to be holding its cards close to the vest. I would not be surprised to see it show even better in a few years’ time. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2028. This is a stunning set of wines from Angelo Gaja and his team in Barbaresco. Those who think 2008 is a truly great year for Nebbiolo must have tasted these wines. In a vintage that is inconsistent across the villages of Barbaresco, Gaja has produced not one but four stellar wines. As fabulous as these wines are, they aren’t especially true to type, as I explain in these notes. The 2008s I tasted in the US showed far better than the bottles I tasted in Barbaresco during the summer. Perhaps the onset of the cool fall weather gave these wines a little more spine than they had during the sweltering heat of August. Readers who want to learn more about the 2011 harvest at Gaja may want to take a look at my video interview with Gaia Gaja and vineyard manager Giorgio Culasso.

Will the 2009 shut down in bottle? Truth is, I don’t know, but the wine is exceptionally beautiful and polished from the very first taste. Ripe, red berries, crushed flowers and deeply spiced notes are woven into an intricate fabric of indescribable class. I am not sure how Angelo Gaja and his team do it, but this is a super-impressive wine in every way. Anticipated maturity: 2017-2029. Angelo Gaja doesn’t say too much about his wines these days. He doesn’t need to. The wines more than speak for themselves. What impresses me most about the 2009s is the elegance of their tannin. This is a vintage where managing the crop load was critical in achieving balance. Gaja is one of the very few growers who got it right. His wines stand out for their textural finesse and sense of harmony. Although Gaja is easily the most glamorous winery in Piedmont, it remains a family affair, with Angelo Gaja’s wife Lucia, and their daughters Gaia and Rossana increasingly involved, and their younger brother Giovanni set to follow in their footsteps. Long-time winemaker Guido Rivella keeps a much lower profile, but he is the man who has produced all of Gaja’s most legendary wines going back to 1970. Angelo Gaja describes 2009 as a year with a lot of rain until June. The bunches on average were loose and the berries small, which resulted in high skin-to-juice ratios, which is quite favorable for ageworthy wines.

2010,Barbaresco,Red,Early,Table,Nebbiolo,Monica Larner,94,2018,2028,27/06/2013,"Smack from the start, the 2010 Barbaresco shows full-on Gajissimo personality with irresistible opulence and intensity, magically contrasted against remarkable smoothness and finesse. Everyone wants to know his secret. The wine delivers seductively rich concentration and integrated oak that is offset by a delicate portfolio of chiseled mineral, dried berry fruit, Spanish cedar, crushed herb, anisette and blue flower. Fruit is sourced from 14 vineyards in Barbaresco. It already leaves a mark, but will reward those who wait. Anticipated maturity: 2018-2028. Just a short while ago, in the midst of one of Italy’s darkest political hours when forming a functioning government seemed like an exercise in futility, someone sent me a Facebook petition proposing Angelo Gaja as a candidate for President of the Republic of Italy. Although Angelo himself would brush it off as jest, that seedling of a (good) idea took the Internet by firestorm. What he has demonstrated over the years, besides from his infectious enthusiasm and keen ability to communicate his thoughts with brilliant clarity and gumption, is a natural ability for leadership. Barbaresco is lucky to have an Angelo Gaja, the Langhe is lucky to have him, and Italy is, too. Importer: Terlato Wines International, Lake Bluff, IL; tel. (847) 604-8900",1099605,10996052010
2011,Barbaresco,Red,Early,Table,Nebbiolo,Monica Larner,93,2017,2035,25/06/2014,"The 2011 Barbaresco opens to a dark garnet color and shows immediate opulence and intensity where its aromas are concerned. There’s an undeniable level of finesse and focus here that goes against all the things you might assume about a warmer vintage like 2011. The mouthfeel is perfectly tempered and smooth with an incredible sense of liveliness and dimension. Fruit is sourced from Gaja’s many vineyard holdings. Drink: 2017-2035. I have some happy news to report from the exciting world of Angelo Gaja. The estate that was notoriously difficult (if not impossible) to visit for those outside the wine trade is now opening its doors to the public. There is a steep entrance fee, but the scheme makes perfect sense in my option. Any wine lover can make an appointment to tour the estate and sample wine for up to 300 euros a person. The money must be paid to charity as none of the proceeds go to Gaja. If you have a favorite non-profit organization, make a donation in that amount. Once you send receipt of payment to Gaja’s tasting room staff, your visit will be granted. It sounds like a fair exchange to me.

2012,Barbaresco,Red,Early,Table,Nebbiolo,Monica Larner,91,2017,2032,28/06/2015,"The 2012 Barbaresco shows different DNA from its previous incarnations. Angelo Gaja usually blends fruit from 14 vineyard sites to make this wine. Starting with this vintage, he has opted to reduce that number to eight vineyards instead. The change is subtle, but you can taste it. At this young stage in the wine's life I was unsure of the results. This Barbaresco is more austere, thorny and nervous compared to the super supple and rich vintages of the immediate past. The nose shows dark fruit follow by cola, garden herb and white pepper. The mouthfeel is silky and firm and edgy.",1099605,10996052012

Dark fruit nuances segue seamlessly to spice, grilled herb, tar, licorice and leather. In keeping with that trademark Gaja touch, those transitions feel polished, long and smooth. The pleasure factor is high on this wine, thanks to the robust concentration it offers and the beautifully velvety nature of its texture. Gaia Gaja tells me that she and her family are especially happy with the quality of tannins achieved in this vintage. They do indeed show a noticeable level of succulence and proverbial crunch.",1099605,10996052013
2014,Barbaresco,Red,Early,Table,Nebbiolo,Monica Larner,94,2018,2030,30/06/2017,"Gaia Gaja tells me 2014 was one of the best vintages ever in Barbaresco, if not the best for her vineyards. She cites the prolonged growing season that continued at a slow rate during the cooler summer months only to speed up thanks to a heat spell at the very end, right before harvest. Nebbiolo loves slow maturity and a prolonged growth cycle: The 2014 vintage did indeed get off to an exceptionally slow start. The 2014 Barbaresco is not austere or astringent. Instead, it offers plump ripeness with rich fruit flavors backed by spice, licorice and tobacco. The wine offers good structure from the point of view of its tannins, yet there is no harshness or bitterness whatsoever.",1099605,10996052014

Gaia Gaja was waiting for the right moon before commencing bottling. This vintage is not unlike the 2005 growing season that saw a good amount of rain in spring and scorching heat in the summer. The risk of downy mildew made vintners extra vigilant. Although the 2015 vintage was not ideal for color fixing Nebbiolo (indeed, this wine is slightly less intense in terms of its color saturation), it did prove an important year for power, structure and dry extract. This is a full and generous expression with a fine, loose texture and rich fruit flavors.",1099605,10996052015
2016,Barbaresco,Red,Young,Table,Nebbiolo,Monica Larner,96,2022,2045,28/06/2019,"I tasted this wine over two sittings, one at the winery and one at my home office a few weeks later. Although I can't claim any extraordinary differences between the two sessions, I noticed a few minimal shifts that are essential to understanding the wine's future aging ability. The 2016 Barbaresco starts off slow at first, showing a small margin of aromatic evolution in the glass. But come back two hours later, and you can almost hear the soft sounds of the symphony playing just below the surface. The 2016 vintage is characterized by the solid intensity and firmness of its aromas, which transcend fruit and veer toward balsamic herb, licorice, tar and smoke instead. The tannins offer a moment of sweetness and softness, before you are aware of their undeniable firmness. In all, there is a certain glossiness or satiny quality to the mouthfeel that underlines the wine's carefully crafted integration. I would describe this as a classic and also a somewhat austere Barbaresco that fully deserves extra cellar time to stretch those tight muscles and grow in volume. This wine will award those who wait.",1099605,10996052016

The wine takes a little while to open fully, and it slowly releases forest berry, powdered licorice, toasted aniseed, spearmint, dried lavender and rosemary essence to build a lasting bouquet. The mouthfeel is streamlined and almost steely, with an extremely linear approach that adds to its length and persistency. The tannins are tucked into the wine's delicate fiber, but you do feel the extra textural firmness of the hot vintage nonetheless. As we have seen in past vintages, more definition is added by a pretty mineral note that is a common thread in these wines from Gaja. Production is 38,000 bottles.",1099605,10996052017

On the nose, ripe black cherries mixed with cassis are all nicely defined and holding on to their freshness. It manifests spicy aromas, almost Moroccan-inspired, as it gradually opens in the glass.

Here, it has an effervescent bouquet with vibrant red berry fruit and superb mineralité. This is extremely well focused, with hints of rose petal emerging with time. The palate is medium-bodied with finer tannin than in previous years. I feel there is still some oak to be fully absorbed, so don't be afraid to cellar this 2005 for another four or five years; but, even at this early stage, you can appreciate its precision on the graphite-infused finish.

The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, well-judged acidity, a touch of white pepper here lending edginess, gradually building to a very composed and structured finish.

This almost ethereal Chambolle finishes with startlingly vivid florality, sweet berry fruit and spice, with just a subtle suggestion of marrow. (None of the Mugnier 2005s register strong animal or meaty characteristics at this early stage.) Frederic Mugnier works from a just-expanded and superbly appointed cellar, and a tasting of his 2004s confirms that he is scoring hits even when Nature does not make it easy as she did the following year. Mugnier advocates unusually late but limited pigeage. “After all,” he opines, “we take great care not to crush the berries, so it doesn’t make sense to do an early pigeage and break them,” and late punch-down further extends the fermentation.

This is polished in texture yet possesses refreshing cut of fruit skin and pepper. Again, we have a darkly-flavored Mugnier 2006, with mysterious meat and mineral low-tones, yet at the same time scarcely less airy or wafting in florality – nor, paradoxically, less concentrated – than was the remarkable 2005. The empty glass here is glorious: redolent of green tea, smoldering autumn foliage, fading violets and framboise. This is as close in character as the two vintages in question come at this address, and it would be fascinating to be able to compare them over the next 12-15 years. When asked what he had done differently in 2006 when compared with 2005, Frederic Mugnier replied, ""Nothing. I want the character of the vintage to be reflected in the wine as much as the terroir, so I try to hold everything else as constant as possible."" While that statement might reflect a bit of hyperbole, it's hard to argue with a collection like Mugnier's 2006s, its wines reflective of their vintage, yet the best of them not really dramatically different from their 2005 counterparts. Certainly they are no less profoundly delicious, and will give more pleasure sooner. (For some details on Mugnier methodology, consult my report in issue 170.) Picking began here ahead of the ban de vendange, ""at absolutely the same levels of sugar as in 2005"" – meaning at 12.75-14% potential alcohol – although Mugnier hastens to note that it was only well along in the evolution of this collection – and to his surprise – that its ability to hold its own qualitatively with some of the great vintages at his estate became evident. ""There wasn't much hail,"" he relates, ""and only in a few sectors did we have to perform serious triage,"" which chez Mugnier – as at Rousseau – means in the vineyard, not on sorting tables.

The vintage was marked by one week of very hot weather towards the end of the growing season, although on average 2009 was not a hot year. The harvest began on September 10. For the 2009s Mugnier destemmed 100% of the fruit as he didn’t feel he had the phenolic ripeness in the stems to use whole clusters. Fermentations lasted about three weeks, an approach which is now pretty much consistent from year to year. ‘Long, slow and gentle,’ Mugnier says. The wines were racked once and were scheduled to be bottled between April and May 2011. The percentage of new oak barrels continues to drop and is now between 15-20% across the entire range. I also tasted all of the 2008s, a vintage in which Mugnier’s wines are stratospheric for their sheer beauty, elegance and pedigree. In 2008 the harvest began on September 26, two full weeks after 2009, which is pretty consistent across domaines in these two years. Today the 2008s appear to have more finesse and silkiness. This will be a fascinating vintage to follow here. A Becky Wasserman Selection, Le Serbet, various American importers, including: Martin Scott Wines, Little Neck, NY; tel.

2009,Cote de Nuits,Red,Early,Table,Pinot Noir,Antonio Galloni,96,2019,2039,25/04/2012,"The 2009 Chambolle-Musigny Les Amoureses is sweet, layered and totally beautiful. At the same time, it is pretty clear the wine has already begun to shut down. With time in the glass, some of the typical weightless energy of Amoureuses comes through, but despite its considerable appeal, the wine is showing only a fraction of its ultimate potential. I imagine the 2009 will enjoy a long drinking window once it awakens from its current slumber. Anticipated maturity: 2019-2039. Frederic Mugnier insists that his 2009s will outlive his 2010s.

A weightless, airy wine, the Amoureuses graces the palate with extraordinary elegance. Despite its finessed personality, there is plenty of underlying structure lurking in the background. The Amoureuses is breathtaking in its sheer beauty, but the best is yet to come. Anticipated maturity: 2020-2040. Leave it to Frederic Mugnier to take a contrarian view of the 2010 vintage. Mugnier is quite clear in espousing his opinion that not only is 2009 a better vintage than 2010, but that the 2009s will be longer-lived as well. His advice to me was to drink the 2010s now and cellar the 2009s. Mugnier’s highly personal take is also reflected in the unconventional order in which these wines were tasted. I have to say, it was quite eye-opening to taste the wines in a different sequence than is the norm, as it keeps the palate and intellect sharp. The harvest started on September 22. As has been the case for a while, the focus is on doing as little as possible to the wines once they are in cellar, which among other things means that new oak is now practically non-existent here.

Here, the Chambolle-Musigny les Amoureuses ‘11 has a precise and delineated bouquet with touches of seaweed infusing the red and black fruit. It is more reserved than other Amoureuses but no less compelling. The palate is medium-bodied with very fine tannins, outstanding tension and a very focused, mineral-laden finish that is quite conservative and almost austere.

The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin. Smooth in texture, perhaps just needs a little more tension, though the acidity is nicely judged.

Both display tremendous precision and delineation. The palate is medium-bodied, edgy and tensile with crisp acidity, so fresh and vital in the mouth. Tasted next to the 1996 Château Margaux, it is clear to see that the 2001 is several steps behind, yet the way it fans out with such confidence and brio on the finish assures that this has a prosperous future.

There is ample fruit here, well defined for the vintage with blackberry and cedar, this bottle demonstrating a subtle fungal character that I have not discerned in previous bottles. There are faint scents of rust iron piping that develop with further aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly dry tannin, offering more fruit than the 2003 Valandraud it was paired with: feisty black pepper and allspice finish with a decent aftertaste. There might be better bottles than this, even so, there is probably not another Margaux that touches this First Growth. I see no harm in broaching bottles now and over the next ten years.

It has an exquisite bouquet with brilliant delineation, scents of redcurrant, raspberry coulis, cold stone (almost flint-like) with pencil-lead and cedar lending it a Pauillac-like sense of aristocratic flair. The palate is extremely well balanced with a supple opening, nigh perfect acidity with a surprisingly citric undercurrent that lends so much freshness and tension. While it does not have the weight and power of say, 2000, 2005 or 2009, it cruises along with utmost harmony and you become smitten by its charms - something that is perhaps in short supply among the First Growths in this vintage.

The palate is well balanced with supple black fruit laced with graphite and tobacco, fully matured but clearly with sufficient substance to last another 15-20 years.

It is not the greatest Château Margaux that the late Paul Pontallier ever made, but it is commendable for the vintage and there is a sense of harmony and composure towards the finish with hints of black pepper and mint lingering on the aftertaste.

On the palate, it's full-bodied, satiny and layered, with a fleshy, multidimensional core, lively acids and an elegant profile, without the muscle of a vintage such as 2005 or 1989 but with more concentration than a supple, open-knit year such as 2000. By the numbers, it's 14% alcohol with a pH of 3.24.",1073401,10734012002
2003,Cote de Beaune,White,Early,Table,Chardonnay,William Kelley,92,2013,2045,31/07/2019,"The 2003 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru is such an atypical vintage that it's hard to know how to score it. With a pH of 3.75 and 14% alcohol, there's almost no acidity—Leflaive opting, unlike many producers, not to add any tartaric acid in this hot, low-yielding vintage. Offering up aromas of preserved peaches, honeycomb, orange rind, white flowers and licorice, it's full-bodied, rich and fat, with an unctuous, oily texture, a massive endowment of chewy dry extract and a long, sweet—despite the wine containing no residual sugar—and exotic finish. While the wine's low acidity makes it a little cumbersome, it's also true that it's aging at a glacial pace, and it's very hard to predict how it will taste in another two decades. This Chevalier is certainly one of the high points of the 2003 white Burgundy vintage but also a wine that exemplifies its extremes.",1073401,10734012003

On the palate, it's full-bodied, layered and textural, with a bright spine of acidity and a tight-knit, compact profile that's still quite firm and unyielding, with good concentration and a somewhat mordant, delicately herbaceous finish. My reservation here is that while this is a fine wine in its introverted, reductive style, it's at odds with the aesthetic that defined the great Leflaive wines of the 1970s and 1980s—wines that were all about elegance and satiny plenitude.",1073401,10734012004

Offering up a stunning bouquet of confit lemons, honeycomb, vine blossom and freshly baked bread, it's full-bodied, ample and multidimensional, with incredible concentration, a firm chassis of structuring dry extract, lively acids and a long finish that still displays considerable youthful drive. This is a muscular, imposing Chevalier that nods to the 1989 vintage in style, though if anything it's better balanced. Today, while it's still a youthful wine, it's beginning to arrive at early maturity, and it's as pleasurable as it is impressive. Sadly, however, I have encountered oxidized bottles of the 2005, and this perfect example only made that more poignant.

On the palate, it's full-bodied, ample and multidimensional, with unusual volume and breadth for the vintage, striking concentration and an incisive spine of acidity, concluding with a long, vibrant and chalky finish.

Offering up aromas of mandarin orange, marmalade, honeycomb, fresh pastry, white flowers and vanilla pod, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and penetrating, with lively acids and a long, exotic finish. While this is drinking well, it's a little open-knit for a 12-year-old Chevalier-Montrachet, especially in magnum, and—as with most Leflaive white Burgundies from this era of endemic premature oxidation—I wouldn't bet on it making old bones.

On the palate, it's full-bodied, lavish and enveloping, with a textural attack, a rich and ample core of fruit and a long, expansive finish. This is a ripe but open-knit vintage of Leflaive's Chevalier, even though with 13.45% alcohol it's lower-octane than all the top vintages of the Pierre Morey era.

Today it appears to lack some mid-palate depth and concentration, but that may come as the wine fleshes out with further time in bottle. Even though it is quite beautiful from a textural standpoint, the Chevalier is the least expressive of the grand crus. With time in the glass, gorgeous floral notes and hints of honey blossom as the Chevalier shows off its sensual personality and beautifully layered fruit. Anticipated maturity: 2020+. Estate Manager Eric Remy has one of the sharpest memories of anyone I have ever met. His recall of specific dates and events is quite remarkable, so I will take advantage of that in reporting a very complete picture of the 2010 growing season. Accoring to Remy, in order to gain some insight on 2010, one has to start with the brutal frost of December 19, 2009, when temperatures dropped to a bone chilling -20C/-4F after having hovered around freezing for a few days prior. The very next day, temperatures shot up to 10C/50F. January was quite dry. A bit of snow fell in early February, but the rest of the month was dry. The last frosts at the domaine were recorded from March 10-14. The weather improved in April, especially towards the end of the month. May and June were cold. Flowering in the domine’s vineyards started on June 5th and ended between June 20 and 22. The first part of July was hot but stable, while the second part of the month was cold and humid. Unstable conditions persisted throughout August. A hailstorm with heavy thunder in Santenay on September 12 was a sign harvest time was approaching. A bit of botrytis was recorded on September 17. The harvest started on September 20. Yields came in around 45 hectoliters per hectare, pretty much in line with 2009, the only domaine I visited where that is the case.

On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, expansive and satiny textured, with a layered and open-knit core that's fleshy but lively, concluding with a long and precise finish.

But what's especially impressive about this Chevalier is its grace and textural elegance in this vintage: while its concentration and amplitude certainly reflect the year, nothing is out of place.

The blend is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller components of Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Merlot currently clocks in at 10% and that quota has been reduced compared to past vintages. The wine is aged in equal parts new and neutral oak. This is a gorgeous wine that surprises most of all thanks to the unexpected nature of its fine and delicate floral aromas. Yes, there's plenty of black fruit and spice at its core. That's par for the course when it comes to a wine of this important extraction, intensity and power.

This vintage saw less time in barrique (about 16 months) but the barrels had more toasting. There is a lasting mineral note of chalk or limestone that frames the dark and opulence quality of fruit at its core. The bouquet is stunning. The wine treads lightly in the palate, with a very elegant and nuanced approach. It really is another gorgeous wine from Tua Rita that shows the profound skill of this winemaking team even when faced with a hot vintage such as this.",1105807,11058072017

Now on the market, the 2018 Giusto di Notri comes together with seamless beauty. This is a rich and generous expression that delivers dark fruit intensity with blackberry and black currant, wrapped tightly together with ample oak notes of spice, tar and cured tobacco. The wine offers smooth transition and rich textural fiber, with soft angles and contours that frame the wine's full-bodied approach. Production is 33,000 bottles.",1105807,11058072018
2001,Toscana,Red,Late,Table,Proprietary Blend,Daniel Thomases,93,2006,2021,23/04/2006,"The 2001 Tignanello is an object lesson in how to make Cabernet work with Sangiovese, the two varieties balancing and enhancing one another in admirable symbiosis. (The percentage of Cabernet, in fact, was reduced from the previous 20% to 15% in this vintage, an important sign - I hope - of how the wind is blowing.) A blackish ruby, its perfectly focused plum and cassis fruit, given an additional complexity by notes of sweet herbs and saddle leather, is fully and completely shaped in flavors of impeccable volume, roundness, and depth, caressing and powerful and with an additional power on the close which promises another 15 years of gratifying drinking.

2003,Toscana,Red,Old,Table,Proprietary Blend,Antonio Galloni,92,2007,2018,28/06/2007,"Antinori’s 2003 Tignanello (85% Sangiovese, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc) is a terrific effort. Typical Sangiovese notes of red cherries, tobacco and underbrush dominate the flavor profile of this intensely flavored Tignanello that manages to be ripe and open, while retaining notable balance and freshness, although the tannins dry out a bit on the back end. This is a delicious Tignanello to enjoy now and over the next decade. The high altitude of the vineyards was clearly an asset in 2003. Anticipated maturity: 2007-2018. Importer: Ste.

Deeply expressive, it reveals black cherries, licorice, tar and sweet toasted oak on a linear, silky-textured frame of great class and elegance, showing outstanding presence on the palate and fine tannins to round out the finish.

2005,Toscana,Red,Old,Table,Proprietary Blend,Antonio Galloni,92,2010,2020,29/06/2008,"Antinori has turned out a very beautiful Tignanello in 2005. The wine possesses perfumed, well-articulated aromatics that meld into a soft, generous core of ripe red fruits. Smoke, mineral, tobacco and spice overtones develop in the glass with air. To be sure, this is a relatively slender Tignanello, and while it doesn’t have the qualities of the superb 2004, it does have the balance to age gracefully for the next decade or so. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2020. My visit to Antinori’s Tignanello property in Chianti Classico provided an object lesson in the challenges of understanding the complexities and nuances of Tuscan terroir, something which can be extrapolated to many other regions within Italy as well. I saw vineyards where the two major terrains in these hills, galestro and alberese, alternated in groups of three to four rows within the same plot. As a result, the plants themselves were at slightly different points in their vegetative cycles. Back in the winery, oenologist Renzo Cotarella prepared a comprehensive tasting of Antinori’s two flagship wines, Tignanello and Solaia, with vintages going back to the mid-1990s. I will report on those verticals, which include a preview of 2006 and 2007, in an upcoming article that will be published in the Italy Report section of www.erobertparker.com. Both Tignanello and Solaia are outstanding in 2005. Readers may recall my enthusiasm over the 2004s. Of course the vintage was exceptional, but it is no accident that those wines were so successful. 2004 was the first vintage in which the lots for these wines were aged separately, with the final blend taking place at the end of the aging period, whereas previously the blend had been assembled just after the completion of malolactic fermentation. Given that wines develop and age in ways that sometimes surprise even the most experienced winemakers, waiting until the wines have had a chance to spend some time in barrel leaves the producer with much more certainty as to the quality and consistency of the final wine. In a difficult vintage such as 2005 the selection of lots prior to assembling and bottling was therefore especially critical. Importer: Ste. Michelle Wine Estates, Woodinville, WA; tel.

2006,Toscana,Red,Mature,Table,Proprietary Blend,Antonio Galloni,92,2014,2024,30/08/2009,"The 2006 Tignanello is especially opulent in this vintage. Masses of dark red fruit, scorched earth and sweet oak emerge as this richly-textured Tignanello flows from the glass. The wine possesses superb density; all it needs is another few years to come together. Today it is remarkably vibrant and primary. Tignanello is 85% Sangiovese, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2024. From top to bottom this is a beautiful set of wines from Antinori. The estate’s 2006 Guado al Tasso, Tignanello and Solaia are all beautiful, even if they don’t appear to possess the elegance of the superb 2004s. Importer: Ste.

The wine has just started its evolutionary track with aromas of blackcurrant, dried blackberry and cherry. This was a warm but balanced vintage that shows beautiful results today and exceeds my already high expectations. There is a steady thickness and determination to the wine that carries it forward. This was the last vintage made in the Tignanello winery before the structure saw a major overhaul. Given the staying power of this historic wine, I feel that this vintage will hold easily for another 20 years or more.",1095391,10953912007
2008,Toscana,Red,Mature,Table,Proprietary Blend,Antonio Galloni,94,2014,2024,30/08/2011,"The 2008 Tignanello is unquestionably one of the wines of the vintage. The 2008 isn’t a huge or obvious Tignanello, rather it is a wine that impresses for its sublime elegance and precision. Understated layers of fruit caress the palate like cashmere in this impeccable, soft wine. There is not a hard edge to be found. Black cherries, tobacco, smoke and licorice are some of the notes that come through on the finish. The flavor profile is decidedly on the dark side, but the wine’s structure is medium in body and intensity. In 2008 the Tignanello has more energy, focus and length than the Solaia. It is a fabulous achievement! The 2008 Tignanello is 80% Sangiovese aged in 300-liter French oak barrels (1/3rd new), 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc, both aged in 100% new 225-liter French oak barriques. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2024. Antinori seems to do everything well these days, from churning out millions of bottles of supermarket wines all the way to turning out superb versions of their many flagship bottlings. This is another impressive set of new releases with a number of highlights. Over the years oenologist Renzo Cotarella has moved away from the super-late harvests of the late 1990s/early 2000s in favor of picking slightly earlier, a decision that has paid off handsomely, especially over the last few years. Antinori’s 2008s, from a vintage that is quite inconsistent across the board, are superb. I remember spending a few days near the estate’s Tignanello and Badia a Passignano estates in mid-August 2008. The days were very hot, but the nights were so cool that a sweater or light jacket was a necessity Importer: Ste. Michelle Wine Estates, Woodinville, WA, tel. (425) 415-3738",1095391,10953912008
2009,Toscana,Red,Early,Table,Proprietary Blend,Antonio Galloni,94,2017,2029,29/06/2012,"The 2009 Tignanello is quite beautiful. Cedar, graphite, sweet herbs, licorice and leather add complexity to a core of highly expressive red fruits. The 2009 impresses for its energy, drive and focus. Today, the 2009 comes across as slightly understated relative to many recent vintages, especially 2007 and 2008. There is a silkiness and polish that is reminiscent of the 2004. Tignanello is 75% Sangiovese, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc from vineyards in San Casciano Val di Pesa, one of the most evocative hillsides in all of Italy. Anticipated maturity: 2017-2029. Longtime winemaker Renzo Cotarella has done a fabulous job with the flagships Tignanello and Solaia in 2009. In my blind tastings the pedigree of those two wines in particular came through with notable eloquence. The 2010 Tignanello and Solaia are both thrilling at this stage. They could very well turn out even better than the 2009s. Readers may want to look at my short video on the 2010s from Antinori on our website. Importer: Ste.

2010,Toscana,Red,Early,Table,Proprietary Blend,Monica Larner,94,2016,2035,28/08/2013,"Humming with energy and life from the very moment you put your nose in the glass, Marchesi Antinori’s 2010 Tignanello shows magnificent aromatic layering and an enormous capacity to peel back and reveal itself in beautiful slow motion. This is an articulate wine with a long story to tell about the quality of its profound 2010 fruit. This Tignanello has the elegance of 2004 and the structure of 2007. A brief note on the structure: The mouthfeel here is not broad and big. Instead, it shows a sharp and elegantly streamlined feel with impressive persistency. Compared to 2009, the Sangiovese component is slightly higher with 80% of the noble Tuscan variety followed by 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc. Anticipated maturity: 2016-2035. The past 12 months mark one of the most exciting times in the long, long history of Antinori. Marchese Piero Antinori and his daughters inaugurated their monumental winery in Bargino, about 20 minutes from Florence in late 2012 after a series of last-minute preparations and sleepless nights. Winery doors officially opened to the public in 2013. It would be impossible to exaggerate to grandeur of this sprawling, multimillion-dollar underground edifice. Angelo Gaja told me at the opening that Antinori’s new winery is the most revolutionary event in modern Italian wine. I agree. With a museum, restaurant and tasting area, it represents Italy’s most ambitious effort yet to make wine the ultimate destination. Importer: Ste.

2011,Toscana,Red,Mature,Table,Proprietary Blend,Monica Larner,93,2015,2027,30/10/2014,"The 2011 Tignanello demonstrates a very ripe and fruit-forward personality with bursting cherry and blackberry folded within sweet spice, moist tobacco and honey-almond paste. Its texture is heavy and dense with sticky spots of sweetness (the alcohol is recorded at 14.5%). With such a fruit-heavy personality, the wine doesn’t reach the soaring heights or brilliant complexity we see in cooler vintages. It should veer toward a greater sense of focus and tightness with more bottle age.",1095391,10953912011
2012,Toscana,Red,Mature,Table,Proprietary Blend,Monica Larner,93,2016,2030,29/10/2015,"The 2012 Tignanello is a very handsome wine with dark fruit nuances that extend far beyond the normal spectrum for Sangiovese (and the smaller percentages of French grapes that complete this wine). This vintage, that started off with a very hot summer and ended with a cool harvest season, show a little more spice and Mediterranean herb on the finish. Grapes were harvested at the end of September and delivered slightly less alcohol than previous vintages. There is a point of freshness but the tannins are mature and yielding. In fact, the tannic management is spot-on and is complimented by the velvety and rich nature of the mouthfeel. Pretty mineral accents add a lasting touch of complexity. The 2012 Tignanello has the qualities for a successful evolution.",1095391,10953912012

The blend remains 80% Sangiovese with 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc but Renzo Cotarella tells me ""stylistically-speaking, this is what we wanted to achieve."" The winemaking formula remains the same, but one of the major differences and benefits to this wine is vineyard age. The celebrated Tignanello single vineyard is now reaching 15 years old. In other words, it is in its production prime. This is a harmonious and beautifully integrated wine that reveals black fruit and baking spice. I'm told the 2014 Tignanello will have a greater percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon and the 2015 vintage will have more Sangiovese.",1095391,10953912013
2014,Toscana,Red,Early,Table,Proprietary Blend,Monica Larner,93,2018,2028,28/04/2017,"Tignanello has this amazing ability of always being, well, Tignanello. Its very DNA makes it among the most distinctive and recognizable wines in the world. I'm happy to report that this is also the case for the 2014 Tignanello that faced very different growing conditions compared to most. The wine is beautiful and balanced with sweet tannins and a supporting oak texture that is neatly folded at the back. The wine is all about measure and proportion, and it aspires to these goals with an impressive sense of natural harmony. This is not an overtly powerful or muscular expression. Instead, it shows a tasty, almost savory form of elegance. This vintage was made with 75% Sangiovese, which means that the Cabernet presence is a tad bigger than normal. Ultimately, this wine is more finessed and delicate, and I appreciate the careful tannic management on display here.",1095391,10953912014
2015,Toscana,Red,Early,Table,Proprietary Blend,Monica Larner,96,2019,2040,06/09/2018,"The 2015 Tignanello is a wine that opens, like a fully blossomed rose, right in front of you. This vintage is immediately accessible, generous and opulent. The wine will surely flesh out and gain focus with more bottle age, but one of the best qualities of this vintage is just how beautiful the wine tastes straight out of the gate. The fruit is beautifully ripe with fresh blackberry and cherry nuances, spice, leather, sweet tobacco and smoke. Up until this vintage, the various blending components that make up Tignanello were vinifed in separate lots. Starting with 2015, the wine is blended sooner in order to achieve better overall integration. The entire Tignanello estate counts 130 hectares of vines, but the single-vineyard ""Tignanello"" that makes this wine is 57 hectares. Some 340,000 bottles were produced.",1095391,10953912015

The wine offers an impeccable level of precision and laser-focus delivery of fruits, spices, tilled earth, espresso beans and Mediterranean herbs. This vintage follows the classic blending formula of 80% Sangiovese with about 13% Cabernet Sauvignon and 7% Cabernet Franc. The vines are now 15 to 20 years old. Compared to the 2015 vintage that ultimately appeared more chewy and succulent, this expression from the iconic 2016 vintage is more vibrant, nervous and jazzed. It shows more savory spice, saltiness and minerality, with a beautifully integrated quality of tannins. Some 320,000 bottles were produced. This wine is at the top of the list of some of the best Tignanello ever made, including the vintages 2007, 2009, 2010, 2013 and 2015.",1095391,10953912016
2017,Toscana,Red,Early,Table,Proprietary Blend,Monica Larner,96,2021,2040,04/06/2020,"The Marchesi Antinori 2017 Tignanello (made with Sangiovese and smaller parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc) is a dark, exuberant and inviting wine. I tasted my sample after a double decanting and was pleased by the profound nature of the wine and the immediate openness of the aromas. There is a symphony of dark fruit with black cherry, plum, spice and sweet tobacco. I am particularly attracted by a distant hint of medicinal or menthol herb that I also discovered in other wines with fruit from the Tignanello estate in 2017. There's a drying mineral note of crushed chalk as well. The heat and dryness of the vintage has added to the aromatic intensity of the wine (yields were reduced by a third), but the mouthfeel is carefully crafted to maintain its softness and smoothness. Fruit comes from a 57-hectare section of the Tenuta Tignanello from a vineyard that is located 390 meters above sea level with Alberese limestone rock and soils of marine origin. The wine is fermented in conical oak tanks and is aged up to 16 months in a combination of mostly French and some Hungarian oak, both new and neutral. Some 300,000 bottles were released in April 2020 after one year of bottle age.",1095391,10953912017
2018,Toscana,Red,Young,Table,Proprietary Blend,Monica Larner,98,2023,2045,06/05/2021,"This wine brought to mind precise imagery of tailcoats, striped dress pants, wingtip collar shirts and other gentlemen's fashion choices from the Roaring Twenties. Sporting a retro but classic personality, the Marchesi Antinori 2018 Tignanello is quite the dapper and jovial wine that hits the market just as much of the world is emerging from a dark chapter of lockdowns and coronavirus curfews. I love the optimism that springs bright with such clarity and detail from within this blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. The 2016 vintage was a benchmark for sure, but I prefer the 2018, thanks to that tinge of nostalgia or emotion that is so deftly rendered in this cool, long growing season. The 2018 vintage offers a deconstructed Tignanello upon first inspection because you can clearly make out the varietal typicity of the grapes, especially the green spice and white pepper of the two Cabernets, along with aromas of crushed limestone that recall the white rocks carefully placed in the vineyards to protect the rows. The wine's fruit weight is contained and polished, and there are no exaggerations, excesses or loose ends. The results are calculated and exacting, especially if you consider the tannic management (with aging in both new and used Hungarian and French oak for up to 16 months) and the quality of the elegant mouthfeel. With time in the glass, those deconstructed elements converge to create unity and balance. The Tignanello vineyard is 57 hectares and sits at a breezy 390 meters above sea level with alberese and galestro soils. Those elevations proved important for shedding excess humidity at the end of this 2018 growing season. Production for this excellent wine is an impressive 345,000 bottles.",1095391,10953912018
